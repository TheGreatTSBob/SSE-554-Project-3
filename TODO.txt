TODO

- Insert code to talk to database in clientThread
- Remove system.out. (Not necessary)
- Make database object to be used on server "synchronous" to ensure all threads
	don't try to update at same time.	
	
If I could go back and redo it, I would make all objects passed through into
arraylists. That way, we wouldnt need to mess with a the client or server stuff
anymore, we would just need to properly prepare the arraylists before sending
and know how to read them after receiving them. This would be much more resistant
to change than the current implementation.
